The up-to date instruction of how to install Data Discovery page has been
located at CMS twiki page:
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/DBS2_discovery

Below are some instructions from the past which can be useful for debugging.
Data discovery relies on the following packages:
1) CherryPy (web framework), version 3.0.1 
http://www.cherrypy.org/wiki/CherryPyDownload
installation: untar it, and run python setup.py install --prefix=<DIR>
I used CherryServer.conf for version 2.x of CherryPy
and used CherryServer3.conf for version 3.x of CherryPy

2) Cheetah (template engine), version 2.0rc7
http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/download.html
installation: untar it and run python setup.py install --prefix=<DIR>

3) SQLAlchemy (SQL ORM tool), version 0.3.11
http://www.sqlalchemy.org/download.myt
installation: untar it and run python setup.py install --prefix=<DIR>

4) I also use cx_Oracle, python ORACLE DB module. I install it manually by myself,
but then found it in /afs/cern.ch/cms/external/lcg/external/cx_Oracle/

5) In a past we used DLS service, for that purpose we should obtain grid credentials:
voms-proxy-init -voms cms

6) set up ORACLE and TNS_ADMIN. The last one points to local tnsnames.ora file which is 
needed for cx_Oracle.

To start server someone needs to do (in bash):
nohup ./DDServer.py 2>&1 1>& /dev/null < /dev/null &


To run Cherrpy behind apache web server we need the following lines in http.conf

RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} dbsdatadiscoveryserver
RewriteRule ^(.*) http://cherrypyserver:8000$1 [P]

here dbsdatadiscoveryserver is the one what people will type in their browser and
cherrypyserver is a server which runs CherryPy on port 8000 elsewhere.
They can be the same or different nodes. As you can see CherryPy server can runs
on arbitrary port and can be run behind a firewall with appropriate rules for 
dbsdatadiscoveryserver.

to start Data discovery within webtools framework use the following:
cmsWeb --base-url https://cmsweb.cern.ch/dbs_discovery --port 8003 --default-page=/


OS X notes:
----------
MySQL and Tomcat has been installed via darwin ports.

sudo /opt/local/bin/mysqld_safe5

I modified /opt/local/share/java/tomcat5/bin/setclasspath.sh
and included into CLASSPATH the mysql jdbc driver
export CLASSPATH=/opt/local/share/java/mysql-connector-java-5.0.jar 

/opt/local/share/java/tomcat5/bin/setenv.sh
sudo /opt/local/share/java/tomcat5/bin/tomcatctl

##################### NEW comments for WEBTOOLS

Starting new version of webtools 1.2, I need to run data discovery as
cmsWeb --base-url https://cmsweb.cern.ch/dbs_discovery_test2 -p 8008 --default-page /DDServer
Also Controllers/DataDiscovery/__init__.py should include /DDServer,
The new set of redirect rules are:
ProxyRequests Off
ProxyPass /dbs_discovery_test2/ http://cmswt01.cern.ch:8008/
ProxyPassReverse /dbs_discovery_test2/ http://cmswt01.cern.ch:8008/
