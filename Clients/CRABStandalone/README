A basic test scripts to test in a stand-alone way the CRAB Data Discovery based on DBS

***** for old EDM data *****

./testDBS_CRAB.py <owner> <dataset> <comma separated list of datatiers>

For example:

./testDBS_CRAB.py bt_2x1033PU761_TkMu_2_g133_OSC bt03_B0sCombBkg Hit

The others python modules it uses are:
 o DataDiscovery.py  --> uses DBSInfo
 o DBSInfo.py --> DBS queries are done using the dbsCgiApi
This assumes that the python CGI API files are in ../PyhtonAPI
that is the case if you download from CVS the whole COMP/DBS/Clients.

***** for new EDM data *****

This is just a very preliminar attempt, not meant to be complete or
correct. It's an example of how to find in DBS root files produced
with CMSSW.

./testDBS_CRAB_EDM.py <datasetPath>

For example:

python testDBS_CRAB_EDM.py /TestPreProdMu10GeV/SIM/GenSimDigi

The others python modules it uses are:
 o DataDiscovery_EDM.py  --> uses DBSInfo
 o DBSInfo_EDM.py --> DBS queries are done using the dbsCgiApi
                      and reading from "Dev/fanfani" database
This assumes the python CGI API files are in ../PyhtonAPI
that is the case if you download from CVS the whole COMP/DBS/Clients.
