1. Use the provide scripts to set install the corresponding products.

2. All scripts take one commandline option (except InstallOracleClient), 
that is the location of installation, where you want that particular 
product to be installed.

It can be same location for all the products.

3. Examples:

InstallLog4CXX.sh  <install-dir>
InstallOracleODBC.sh <install-dir>
InstallUnixODBC.sh <install-dir>

4. InstallAll.sh will call upon all scripts and install 
all of them in one path. This is most CONVENIENT and RECOMMENDED.

    InstallAll.sh <install-dir>

5. InstallAll.sh will also generate setup.sh script to setup DBS Environment.

NOTE: InstallAll.sh will NOT install OracleClient, following steps
      explain installation of Oracle Client.


6. InstallOracleClient intalls and configures ORACLE Client

6.1 This script modifies the Oracle Instant Client installation kit
such that it is easily used with DBS. 

6.2 It modifies the install
directory layout to resemble that of the real Oracle client
installation. 

6.3 The script leaves behind an environment configuration script
you can source to get fully functional Oracle execution and
build environment.

Usage: InstallOracleClient ZIP-DIRECTORY DESTINATION 

ZIP-DIRECTORY specifies the directory in which three Oracle
zip files must be available; you can obtain these from the
http://otn.oracle.com (Download -> Oracle Instant Client -> Instant
Client for Linux x86 -> Read and agree to the license -> Sign
up for an OTN account or use existing one -> Save file):

instantclient-basic-linux32-10.1.0.3.zip
instantclient-sqlplus-linux32-10.1.0.3.zip
instantclient-sdk-linux32-10.1.0.3.zip

DESTINATION is the directory under which you want to install the
Oracle components.  You will get the standard Oracle installation
tree (lib, bin, admin, java, ...) directory structure here.

NOTE: Mind that this script is taken fron PhEDEx Deployment scripts
      So the instructions there in make References to PhEDEx, 
      just ignore them for DBS.  

Check required utlities.  Not all SL3 systems have all RPMs.
