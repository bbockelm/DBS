This file contains information required to configure the DBS Server.

Following items are required to be configured, for DBS Server to work properly.

1. ORACLE Client
2. unixODBC
3. ORACLE ODBC Driver
4. LOG4CXX

Look at INSTALL for further details how to install these products. Helping scripts are [provided.

After completion of installation one need to follow folowing steps,

1. Edit $ODBCHOME/etc/odbcinst.ini to point to proper ORACE Driver, Entries look like,

[oracle]
Description     =
Driver          = /oracle_odbc_home/lib/liboraodbc.so
Driver64        = /oracle_odbc_home/lib/liboraodbc.so
Setup           = /oracle_odbc_home/lib/liboraodbc.so
Setup64         = /oracle_odbc_home/lib/liboraodbc.so
UsageCount      = 1
CPTimeout       =
CPReuse         =

Example is generated as $ODBCHOME/etc/odbcinst.ini.example


2. Edit $ODBCHOME/etc/odbc.ini, it contains your DSN for ORACLE Driver, Entries look like,

[OracleTest]
Description     = oracle
Driver          = oracle
Trace           = No
TraceFile       =
DB              = cmsr
USER            = cms_dbs_reader
PASSWORD        = xxxxxxxxxxxxx

Example is in $ODBCHOME/etc/odbc.ini.example

3. $DBSHOME is the location where you are deploying DBS.

4. Look at $DBSHOME/etc/server.conf

a. Make sure log: points to $DBSHOME/etc/server.conf  

example,

    log: /home/devDBS/etc/log4cxx.properties

b. Make sure you have your ORACLE parameters defined properly (These are used by DBS Server)

Example:

dsn: OracleTest
dbuser: cms_dbs_reader
dbpasswd: xxxxxxxxxxxx

5. make sure env. variable DBSCONFIG points to $DBSHOME/etc/server.conf

6. Source setup_dbs.sh

   . ./setup_db.sh
