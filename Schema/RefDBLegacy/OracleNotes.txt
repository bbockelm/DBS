DBS schema notes, 2005-10-04

Changes made
  - Removed "insert into" from SchemaRevision.  Didn't
    understand how it's supposed to work -- if we load
    multiple schema versions, do we get a tag for every
    version we've loaded?  In which case how does one
    read anything from the table?

  - "int" -> "integer"
  - "date" -> "float" (UNIX UTC high-res timestamp)

  - Pulled all constraints out of tables and gave them
    names, put them into appropriate tablespaces.

  - Separated tables into groups, group per SQL file, along
    with their associated declarations (keys etc.)

  - Added sequences for unique integer keys.  Removed
    all "auto_increment" labels on columns.  Removed
    separate index key on tables where it appeared to
    make no sense (unique key on event collection etc.)

  - Replaced all table names with t_table_name instead
    of TableName, and all columns names with column_name
    instead of ColumnName.

  - Shortened various long table names so we can fit
    constraint names into Oracle limits (32 characters).

  - Shortened many column names to avoid duplication with
    the table name (FooBar.FooBarID => t_foo_bar.id).

  - Rearranged all createdby/modifiedby to have the same
    order and be in the same position (= end) in all the
    tables.

  - Made lots of columns "not null".

  - Made some name-like columns of uniform length.

  - Added processed_dataset column in t_analysis_dataset,
    as reported missing in a meeting some time ago.

  - Heavily axed some random tables that related to extra
    info on event collections.  These didn't appear well
    thought out at all.  (See OracleExtra.sql.)

Pending issues
  - There are practically no indexes to speak of, only
    those created for primary keys, and covering indexes
    for foreign keys -- but none that cover query patterns.

  - Lots of missing covering indexes on foreign keys.
    I added most that I spotted, but some no doubt
    slipped.  Need to double-check these.

  - We need to design storage for most of the tables.  This
    will be quite some work, and we'll have to do it while
    we gain experience on the data layouts, table usage and
    most common queries.

Planned changes
  - Need to move all "not null" columns before "null" ones.
  - Verify "not null" vs. "null" columns.
  - Schema revision management
  - Access roles and other authentication stuff.
