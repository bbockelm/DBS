/**
 * $Id$
 *
 * A class that can create the database connections <code>java.sql.Connection</code> managed either 
 * by tomcat connection pooling or external source. It also has method to create a prepared statements 
 * <code>java.sql.PreparedStatement</code> that can be used to execute SQL queries. 
 * For connection pooling only one object of this class can be made  and thus it works as a singleton. 
 * The connection pooling that this class use is standard pooling provided by apache tomcat. 
 * For externally managing the connections a static method getConnection can be called which 
 * create a new connection every time it is called.
