**********************************************************************
* Organisation

** Projects

Champions + members.  Broken down to fairly small projects, any one
person might champion two projects and be a member in three or four
others.  Champion responsible for reporting, calling meetings, etc.
Otherwise everybody works in peer structure.  Some projects might be
short-lived, others might be longer-lived.

** Schedule

Built from components proven before then.

Preceding system test milestones.

Spreading data challenge into integration testbeds, DC06 dedicated
focusing point.

FIXME: Expanded version of the bits about scheduling in baseline
description.

FIXME: I think we should describe the processes of development of new
components that get then integrated and eventually moved into
production. There is an integration testbed and a set of services
challenges that prove a new revision of services and functionalities,
performed in an integration environment, that then can be released for
production when certified. etc pp

FIXME: Interactions of new EDM and new dataset bookkeeping system.
Try to do in the new way where possible.  Only keep separate what
required, will consider at that time how to do the fork.  Demonstrate
upgrades.

*** Intermediate goals (now, six months, baseline)

Now.  Summer.  Magnet test ~ Oct/Nov.  DC06.  End of 2006.  April 2007.

Baseline in place for DC06.

Integration testbed plans.

What needs to be done immediately

Development process, who does what.

milestones
  baseline always working
  system tests; in beginning not all compoennts, inreasingly
    more components into testbed, when work, moved into production

 prs milestone to deliver condition details / volumes / latencies / rates?


** Operation

Migration policy.  New EDM.
