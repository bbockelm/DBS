\begin{abstract}
The CMS experiment has implemented a flexible and 
powerful approach enabling users to find data within 
the CMS physics data catalog. The Dataset Bookkeeping 
Service (DBS) comprises a database and the services 
used to store and access metadata related to its physics 
data. In addition to the existing WEB based and programmatic 
API, a generalized query system has been designed and built. 
This query system has a query language that hides the 
complexity of the underlying database structure. This provides 
a way of querying the system that is straightforward for 
CMS data managers and physicists. The DBS Query Language 
uses the ANTLR tool to build the input query parser and tokenizer, 
then a query builder using a graph representation of the 
DBS schema constructs the actual SQL sent to underlying database. 
We will describe the design of the query system and provide 
details of the language components. We will also provide an 
overview of how this component fits into the overall data 
discovery system, as well as providing access to information 
about Data Quality and Luminosity.

\section{ITEMS TO COVER}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Need for a flexible QL, instead of static web pages
\item QL as Data search tool, and not a data mining tool (as of yet)
\item Some (not a whole lot !!!) implementation details.
\item Integration with DD and CLI
\item Future plans, DAS and beyond and also looking at Data Mining..
\end{enumerate}
